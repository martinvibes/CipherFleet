## What is CipherFleet?

CipherFleet is **Battleship on the blockchain** — but with a twist that makes it actually work.

In normal Battleship, you trust your opponent not to cheat. On a normal blockchain, that trust problem gets *worse* — anyone can read the contract storage and see where your ships are.

CipherFleet solves this with **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**. Your ship positions are stored on-chain as encrypted data that nobody can read — not your opponent, not a server, not even the smart contract itself. When someone attacks, the contract checks if they hit a ship by running math *directly on the encrypted data*. It never decrypts your ship positions. Ever.

**Think of it this way:**
- Normal blockchain: your ships are written in plain text on a public whiteboard
- CipherFleet: your ships are locked in a mathematical safe that can answer "is there a ship here?" without ever opening

## How It Works

### The 30-Second Version

```
1. You place your ships → positions are encrypted and stored on-chain
2. Opponent attacks a cell → the contract runs FHE.eq() on encrypted data
3. Result comes back → "Hit" or "Miss" — that's ALL that's revealed
4. Ship positions? Still encrypted. Always.
```

### The Visual Version

### What Happens During an Attack

```

   Smart contract runs:
   FHE.eq(grid[3][3], encrypted(1))
         │
         ▼                            Ship position

   math on encrypted data ──────────► during this process

         ▼

## Why FHE? Why Not Just Hide It Normally?

Great question. Here's why every other approach fails:

| Approach | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| **Trust a server** | Server can cheat, get hacked, or go offline |
| **Commit-reveal** | Player commits a hash, but can lie about what they committed after seeing your attack |
| **Zero-knowledge proofs** | Proves something is valid, but doesn't let the contract *compute* on hidden data |
| **FHE (what we use)** | Contract does real math on encrypted data. Nobody can cheat. Nobody can read it. Just math. |

FHE is the only approach where the contract can answer "is there a ship here?" without anyone — including the contract — ever knowing where the ships actually are.

## The Game

### Ships

| Ship | Size | Cells |
|------|------|-------|
| Carrier | 4 cells | ████ |
| Destroyer | 3 cells | ███ |
| Submarine | 2 cells | ██ |
| Patrol Boat | 2 cells | ██ |

**Total: 11 encrypted cells per player on an 8×8 grid**

### Game Flow

## Smart Contract

The core of CipherFleet is a Solidity contract built on [Fhenix CoFHE](https://fhenix.io).

**Key functions:**
- `placeShips()` — encrypt and store ship positions on-chain
- `attack(row, col)` — run `FHE.eq()` to check if a cell has a ship
- `resolveAttack()` — read the decrypted hit/miss result
- `getGameState()` — check game phase, scores, whose turn it is

**FHE operations used:**
| What | Does |
|------|------|
| `FHE.asEuint8(value)` | Encrypts a number (1 = ship, 0 = water) |
| `FHE.eq(a, b)` | Compares two encrypted values — returns encrypted true/false |
| `FHE.allowThis(handle)` | Lets the contract use the encrypted data |
| `FHE.getDecryptResult()` | Reads the decrypted yes/no answer |

The contract compiles and is ready for deployment on **Arbitrum Sepolia**.

## Why Hidden-State Gaming Needs FHE

Games with secrets — Poker, Battleship, Mafia — have always been broken on-chain. Every solution so far requires trusting someone: a server, an oracle, or hoping your opponent doesn't cheat the commit-reveal scheme.

FHE changes this completely. For the first time, a smart contract can hold secrets it can't even read, and compute on data it can't see. Battleship is the cleanest proof of this — one encrypted check per attack, one yes/no answer back. No complex circuits, no trusted setup, no multi-party computation. Just `FHE.eq()`.

CipherFleet isn't just a game — it's a proof that **hidden-state gaming on-chain actually works**. And if it works for Battleship, it works for Poker, for Mafia, for any game where players need to keep secrets from each other and from the chain itself.

> *"The first on-chain game where ship positions are mathematically hidden — not just hidden by trust. No server, no oracle, no commit-reveal hack — just math."*
